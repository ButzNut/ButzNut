Hey there! My name is Janis Butz and I work at the Max-Planck-Institute for the study of Criminology, Security and Law.

I create special applications in VR and Non-VR environments to support and conduct studies.

I mainly use Unity3D to create research applications, but also other tools to create cutting edge research projects.

But also creating and managing webservers, Large Languages Model Servers and self hosted services are part of my work.
