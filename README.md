My name is Janis Butz, and I am a researcher at the Max Planck Institute for the Study of Criminology, Security, and Law.

I develop specialized applications for virtual reality (VR) and non-VR environments to facilitate and support research studies.

My primary development environment is Unity3D, though I utilize other tools as needed to create state-of-the-art research projects.

My responsibilities also include the creation and management of web servers, large language model servers, and self-hosted services.
